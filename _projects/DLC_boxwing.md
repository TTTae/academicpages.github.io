excerpt: Box wing aircraft have several appealing advanteages like siginicantlty reduced wingspan and more compact wing structures. Besides, the existence of the two wings have also introduces the capability of direct lift control(DLC). To explore the potential value of this and gain knowledges about box wing design. a team was built and a <a href="https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%9B%BD%E5%AE%B6%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6%E7%94%9F%E5%88%9B%E6%96%B0%E6%80%A7%E5%AE%9E%E9%AA%8C%E8%AE%A1%E5%88%92 ">National University Student Innovation Program</a> was applied to fund the research. Several box wing aircrafts was design and built. A DFC control Law was also designed by parametric identifications based on flight tests. DFC flight tests were performed and the data was analyzed. It was shown that the DFC for box wing aircraft has potential values for overload controls like gust alleviation, while it has limited capablity to change the trajectory of the aircraft as the control force will soon be cancelled out by the change of aircraft angle of attack. **[read more](/projects/DLC_boxwing/)**

## Motivations
* Figure out how much benifits a box wing aircraft can acquire from DLC
* Learn how to design an aircraft(Including aerodynamic design and structure design processes)
* Learn how the aircraft can be controlled by flight control systems
* Get some usage experience on relative softwares
* Learn how to work as a team to solve a problem


## Role&Responsibility

* Aerodynamic design of the box wing aircraft
* Structure design of the wings
* Deesign the control law of direct lift control and vallidate it through simulation
* Design the dirct lift Control experiments
* Analyze flight data and conclude the experiment. 

## Challenges & Proposed Solutions
### Challenges: Knowledge Gap
While numerous challenges and difficulties ocurred during the projects, the most bothering one is the knowledge gap. The projects started when we were sophomores, as the curriculums relating to aircraft design would comming at next year, we could not expect to acquire relative knowledges from these courses or the project process will be delayed.

### Proposed Solutions:
#### People and Papers!

 

#### Gradient Based (Adjoint) Methods


#### Surrogate Based Optimization



## Optimization Framework

### optimization problems



## Projects Outcome&Highlights

## Final thoughts
