Biography
======
I am a second year postgraduate student in school of aeronautics at Northwestern Polytechnical University, major in Flight Vehible Design advised by Prof.Yu Hu.  
My research primarily involve aerodynamic optimization algorithms and its applications. I'm working with ducted fan projectes and trying to find out the design strategies from an surrogate based optimization approach. I also gained experience on aircraft system design and optimization from matches and projects.  
I will apply for Ph.D next year and I am interested in optimization algorithms and design & optimization related programs. If you're interested, donâ€™t hesitate to contact me. My information is attached in [CV page](https://tsingqaq.github.io/cv/).
