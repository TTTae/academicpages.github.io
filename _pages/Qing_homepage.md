I am a PhD candidate at [SUMO lab](http://sumo.intec.ugent.be/), [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be/en), under the supervision and guidance of Professor [Tom dhaene](http://sumo.intec.ugent.be/tdhaene) and Dr [Ivo couckuyt](http://sumo.intec.ugent.be/icouckuy) for Data efficient machine learning techinique. 

My master was finished about flight vehicle design in school of aeronautics at [Northwestern Polytechnical University](http://en.nwpu.edu.cn/), under the supervision and guidance of Professor Hu Yu. As a member of of the lab which [made the first successful flight of double ducted fan in China](http://www.miit.gov.cn/n1146290/n1146402/n1146445/c5637908/content.html), my researches primarily involve optimization algorithms and their applications on [ducted fan VTOL aircrafts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ducted_fan). For instance, improving ducted fan aircrafts' performance through high fidelity computational methods (Computational Fluid Dynamics) and efficient global optimizations ([Kriging/Gaussian Process Regression ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriging) based sequential design method).  I also have some experience in design and optimization of fixed wing aircrafts. I am still keeping an eye on aerodynamic optimization & multi-disciplinary optimization and are open to any potential cooperations.
