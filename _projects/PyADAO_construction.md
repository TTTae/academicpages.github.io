excerption: The fast improvement of aerodynamic shape optimization methedologies(i.e geometric parametrization, Adjoint method, surrogate models) has introduced the change that state-of-the-art methods can be used at the very beginning of an aircraft design, even in conceptual design processes. While many opensource tools like OpenMDAO, SUAVE, and SU2 are widely used, a framework must be consturcted to properly wrap these tools and offer a flexible enviroments for design and optimization problem formulation. Thus a Python based aircraft design, analysis, optimization framework was consturcted. A flying wing configuration drag(induced drag) reduce optimization was carried out to validate the code and a superior one was found.

The PyADAO 
{: .notice--success}
## Motivation&Backgrounds
Besides the introduction in [projects page](https://tsingqaq.github.io/projects/), the construction of PyADAO could also be help of :
* Providing a platform for aircraft design optimizations
* Learning and implementing aircraft optimization ralated theories
* Learning and practice Python programming language

## Survey of related codes/software 
A survey was conducted to find the exist aircraft design optimization frameworks, some of them are listed in the following tables:

## Why Python
* Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly
and integrate systems more effectively
<p align="right">Python.org</p>
* Python excels at interfacing with other languages, making it particularly useful to wrap numerically intensive disciplinary computations which are usually implemented in C/C++ or Fortran
<p align="right">PyACDT [paper](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/6.2008-5955)</p>
*  Pythonâ€™s combination of object oriented programming, duck typing, concise language, portability in open source, and community standard as glueware has driven our decision.
