As a global competition, Airbus 'Fly Your Ideas' challenges students worldwide to innovate for the future of aviation and shows growing concern for students of all backgrounds. As one the participant teams in 2015, team AFT-BURNER-REVERSER designed an anti-collision system for aircrafts to be able to detect and prevent potential collisions on the ground. The system was validated through a prototype and the appealing work made us be selected as one of the finalists teams. And we're also proud that we're the only one team that made up of all bachalers.
