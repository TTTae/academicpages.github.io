title: Airbus 'Fly Your Ideas' Competition 2015
excerpt: As a global competition, Airbus 'Fly Your Ideas' challenges students worldwide to innovate for the future of aviation and shows growing concern for students of all backgrounds. As one the participant teams in 2015, team AFT-BURNER-REVERSER designed an anti-collision system for aircrafts to be able to detect and prevent potential collisions on the ground. The system was validated through a prototype and the appealing work made us selected as one of the five finalists teams. And we're also proud that **we're the only one team that made up of all bachalers**. **[read more](/projects/FYI_2015/)**

_This is a post that first appeared on the [Software Sustainability Institute's blog](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2018-04-05-so-you-want-start-data-science-institute-achieving-sustainability) and was co-authored by myself, Alejandra Gonzalez-Beltran, Robert Haines, James Hetherington, Chris Holdgraf, Heiko Mueller, Martin O'Reilly, Tomas Petricek, Jake VanderPlas (authors in alphabetical order) during [a workshop](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/RSE4DataScience18) at the Alan Turing Institute._

## Role&Responsibility
As a teammate, besides the normal team work, I was mainly responsible for 
* build the ultrasonic wave prototype system using <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/"><font color="blue">Arduino</font></a>. 
* design and conduct a control experiment
* make renderings

A glance of team **Aft-Burner-Reverser** at competition:

## Motivation&Backgrounds

The increasing traffic flow of airlines have imposed greate pressure to not only air traffic controllers but also airports. The ground collissions happens from time to time, and the accidents will not only charge expensive repare fee for the airliners, but also keep these airplanes away from making benifites in the air. Besides, passenger experience will also be ruined in this case.

Motivated by this, we, team AFT-BURNER-REVERSER, aims at developing a system: **LIVAS**, to prevent these accidents. LIVAS will alert pilots and ground crew in case a potential collision risk was detected and identified.


## Challenges & Proposed Solutions

### Challenges: 

The main challenges of LIVAS can be concluded in to three points:

**Effective:** LIVAS's key ability is to be able dectet the threat, this can be devided in to two specific requirments:
* distance detect capability
* algorithms to determine if the case was a collision threat
There're many technologies already been used as for distance measurment like laser, utra-red line, sonar, etc. which one is best for LIVAS still needs further consideration.

**Reliable:** LIVAS needs to detect most of the risks and make warnings. It is also expected to work well on all weathers

**Light:** Aircraft engineerings fight for every gram to make the aircraft lighter to make more profite, if LIVAS is expected to be mounted on the airplane, it should be as light as possible.

### Approaches: 

In order to validate varies distance detection technologies, two different prototype systems were built by us, one used the utra-red line and the other adopted the sonar. A control experiment was also carried out to see the effectiveness of these prototypes. LIVAS system utilize the onboeard computer and some relative devices to make calculate, thus only sensors and some wires need to be added to the airlines. Finally, a mass model was built to evaluate the weight increasement.

## Final Thoughts

Thanks for my greate, lovely and motivating teammates, we cannot made into the final without any of you :) 

The lack of sensibility at wing tip is the main cause of ground collisions. While as the development of technologies like virtual reality and augmented realityï¼Œ pilots are able to obtain more knowledges around the airplane, like the DAS system on Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter, which can help pilots "look through foors". this accidents will eventually be solved.

Another ground collision accidents was that the ground vehicles hitting the airplane, and this also need carefully concern. Some alert systems should also be used and related polociesc are expected to be perfected.
