An aircraft design optimnization was performed for [AIAA DBF](https://www.aiaadbf.org/General-Info/ "AIAA DBF") . The [score model](https://www.aiaadbf.org/Scoring/ "score model") of the competition draw special concern as that both geometry paramters and mission performance were involved in, and the contradiction of these parameters speified that a design optimization must be performed.  An aircraft preliminary design coupled with mission planning framework was built based on [PyADAO](https://tsingqaq.github.io/projects/PyADAO_construction/ "PyADAO") to find a design that could get the highest score. A tandem wing configuration was found for the final design.
