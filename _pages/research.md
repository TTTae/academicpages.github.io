Enhancing Size Generalization in GNNs through Disentangled Representation Learning
======
* __Zheng Huang__, Qihui Yang, Dawei Zhou and Yujun Yan
* International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2024) [[Arxiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04601)


  * Researched the generalization of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) through disentangled representation learning  
  * Proposed a novel and model-agnostic framework designed to disentangle size factors from graph representations
  * Employed size- and task-invariant augmentations, introducing a decoupling loss to minimize shared information in hidden representations
  * Conducted in-depth research on OOD generalization, explainable GNN models and disentangled representation learning


Empowering Next POI Recommendation with Multi-Relational Modeling   
======
* __Zheng Huang__, Jing Ma, Natasha Zhang Foutz and Jundong Li
* Special Interest Group on Information Retrieval (SIGIR 2022) [[Arxiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12288)


  *  Studied on Points of Interests (POI) recommendation by capturing the influence of multiple relations
  *  Utilized multiple Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) with Self-Attention mechanism to capture multiple user-user social relations (family or colleague) and user-location check-in relations
  *  Adopted coupled Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to capture the mutual influence between users and POIs over time
  *  Conducted in-depth research on recommender system, sequential recommendation and Graph Convolutional Networks



Assessing the Causal Impact of COVID-19 Related Policies on Outbreak Dynamics
======
* Jing Ma, Yushun Dong, __Zheng Huang__, Daniel Mietchen and Jundong Li
* International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW 2022) [[Arxiv]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.01315.pdf)


  *  Studied on the causal effect of different policies in reducing the spread of COVID-19 in the US
  *  Worked on a team and developed a neural network framework (GCNs&RNNs) based on time-varying observation data to control the influence of confounders, and integrated data from different data sources
  *  Investigated the problem of causal inference and COVID-19 observational social network data
