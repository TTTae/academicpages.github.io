title: Airbus 'Fly Your Ideas' Competition 2015
excerpt: As a global competition, Airbus 'Fly Your Ideas' challenges students worldwide to innovate for the future of aviation and shows growing concern for students of all backgrounds. As one the participant teams in 2015, team AFT-BURNER-REVERSER designed an anti-collision system for aircrafts to be able to detect and prevent potential collisions on the ground. The system was validated through a prototype and the appealing work made us selected as one of the five finalists teams. And we're also proud that **we're the only one team that made up of all bachalers**. **[read more](/projects/FYI_2015/)**

_This is a post that first appeared on the [Software Sustainability Institute's blog](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2018-04-05-so-you-want-start-data-science-institute-achieving-sustainability) and was co-authored by myself, Alejandra Gonzalez-Beltran, Robert Haines, James Hetherington, Chris Holdgraf, Heiko Mueller, Martin O'Reilly, Tomas Petricek, Jake VanderPlas (authors in alphabetical order) during [a workshop](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/RSE4DataScience18) at the Alan Turing Institute._

## Role&Responsibility
As a teammate, besides the normal team work, I was mainly responsible for 
* build the ultrasonic wave prototype system using <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/"><font color="blue">Arduino</font></a>. [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/)
* design and conduct a control experiment
* make renderings

A glance of team **Aft-Burner-Reverser** at competition:

## Motivation&Backgrounds


<img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TybqkclacaU/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="drawing" width="600px" height="400px"/> 

The increasing traffic flow of airlines have imposed greate pressure to not only air traffic controllers but also airports. The ground collissions happens from time to time, and the accidents will not only charge expensive repare fee for the airliners, but also keep these airplanes away from making benifites in the air. Besides, passenger experience will also be ruined in this case.

Motivated by this, we, team AFT-BURNER-REVERSER, aims at developing a system: **LIVAS**, to prevent these accidents. LIVAS will alert pilots and ground crew in case a potential collision risk was detected and identified.


## Challenges & Proposed Solutions

### Challenges: 

The main challenges of LIVAS can be concluded in to three points:

**Effective:** The main part of LIVAS is the ability to be able dectet the threat, this can be devided in to two specific requirments:
* distance detect capability
* algorithms to determine if the case was a collision threat
There're many technologies already been used as for distance measurment like laser, utra-red line, sonar, etc. which one is best for LIVAS still needs further consideration.

**Reliable:** LIVAS needs to detect most of the risks and make warnings. It is also expected to work well on all weathers

**Light:** Aircraft engineerings fight for every gram to make the aircraft lighter to make more profite, if LIVAS is expected to be mounted on the airplane, it should be as light as possible.

### Approaches: 

In order to validate varies distance detection technologies, two different prototype systems were built by us, one used the utra-red line and the other adopted the sonar. A control experiment was also carried out to see the effectiveness of these prototypes. LIVAS system utilize the onboeard computer and some relative devices to make calculate, thus only sensors and some wires need to be added to the airlines. Finally, a mass model was built to evaluate the weight increasement.

## Projects Outcome

_How to create a successful environment where people feel valued?_

From our experience, there are four main points that help create an enjoyable and successful environment to facilitate success and makes people feel valued in their role.

**Physical Space**. The physical space that hosts the group plays an important role to creating an enjoyable working environment. In most cases there will be a lot of collaboration going on between people within the group but also with people from other departments within the university. Having facilities (e.g. meeting spaces) that support collaborative work on software projects will be a big facilitator for successful outputs.

**Get Started Early**. Another important aspect to creating a successful environment is to connect the group to other researchers with the university early on. It is important to inform people about the tasks and services the group provides, and to involve people early on who are well connected and respected within the university so that they can promote and champion the group within the university. This helps get the efforts off the ground early, and spread the word and bring on further opportunities.

**Celebrate Each Other's Work**. While it may not be possible to convince the broader academic community to treat software as first-class research output, data science organisations should explicitly recognise many forms of scientific output, including tools and software, analytics workflows, or non-standard written communication. This is especially true for projects where there is no "owner", such as major open-source projects. Just because your name isn't "first" doesn't mean you can't make a valuable contribution to science. Creating a culture that celebrates these efforts makes individuals feel that their work is valued.

**Allow Free Headspace**. The roles of individuals should (i) enable them to work in collaboration with researchers from other domains (e.g., in a support role on their research projects) and (ii) also allow them to explore their own 'research' ideas. Involvement in research projects not only helps these projects develop reliable and reproducible results but can be an important source to help identify areas and tasks that are currently poorly supported be existing research software. Having free head space allows individuals to further pursue ideas that help solve the identified tasks. There are a lot of examples for successful open source software projects that have started as small side projects.

## Projects Highlights

_How do we establish career trajectories that value people's skills and experience in this new inter-disciplinary domain?_

The final dimension that we consider is that of the career progression of data scientists. Their career path generally differs from the traditional academic progression, and the traditional academic incentives and assessment criteria do not necessarily apply to the work they perform.

**Professional Development.** A data science institute should prepare its staff both in technical skills (such as software development best practices and data-intensive activities) as well as soft skills (such as team work and communication skills) that would allow them to be ready for their next career step in multiple interdisciplinary settings. Whether it is in academia or industry, data science is inherently collaborative, and requires working with a team composed of diverse skillsets.

**Where Next.** Most individuals will not spend their entire careers within a data science institute, which means their time must be seen as adequately preparing them for their next step. We envision that a data scientist could progress in their career either staying in academia, or moving to industry positions. For the former, career progression might involve moving to new supervisory roles, attaining PI status, or building research groups. For the latter, the acquired technical and soft skills are valuable in industrial settings and should allow for a smooth transition. Members should be encouraged to collaborate or communicate with industry partners in order to understand the roles that data analytics and software play in those organisations.

**The Revolving Door.** The career trajectory from academia to industry has traditionally been mostly a one-way street, with academic researchers and industry engineers living in different worlds. However, the value of data analytic methods cuts across both groups, and offers opportunities to learn from one another. We believe a Data Science Institute should encourage strong collaborations and a bi-directional and fluid interchange between academic and industrial endeavours. This will enable a more rapid spread of tools and best-practices, and support the intermixing of career paths between research and industry. We see the institute as 'the revolving door' with movement of personnel between different research and commercial roles, rather than a one-time commitment where members must choose one or the other.

## Final Thoughts

Though these efforts are still young, we have already seen the dividends of supporting RSEs and Data Scientists within our institutions in the USA and the [UK](https://zenodo.org/record/495360#.WrE2A9bLjCL). We hope this document can provide a roadmap for other institutions to develop sustainable programs in support of cross-disciplinary software and research.
