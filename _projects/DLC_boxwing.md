excerpt: Box wing aircraft have several appealing advanteages like siginicantlty reduced wingspan and more compact wing structures. Besides, the existence of the two wings have also introduces the capability of direct lift control(DLC). To explore the potential value of this and gain knowledges about box wing design. a team was built and a [National University Student Innovation Program](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%9B%BD%E5%AE%B6%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6%E7%94%9F%E5%88%9B%E6%96%B0%E6%80%A7%E5%AE%9E%E9%AA%8C%E8%AE%A1%E5%88%92 "National University Student Innovation Program") was applied to fund the research. Several box wing aircrafts was design and built. A DFC control Law was also designed by parametric identifications based on flight tests. DFC flight tests were performed and the data was analyzed. It was shown that the DFC for box wing aircraft has potential values for overload controls like gust alleviation, while it has limited capablity to change the trajectory of the aircraft as the control force will soon be cancelled out by the change of aircraft angle of attack.
