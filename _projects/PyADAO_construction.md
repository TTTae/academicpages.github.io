The fast improvement of aerodynamic shape optimization methedologies(i.e geometric parametrization, Adjoint method, surrogate models) has introduced the change that state-of-the-art methods can be used at the very beginning of an aircraft design, even in conceptual design processes. While many opensource tools like OpenMDAO, SUAVE, and SU2 are widely used, a framework must be consturcted to properly wrap these tools and offer a flexible enviroments for design and optimization problem formulation. Thus a Python based aircraft design, analysis, optimization framework was consturcted. A flying wing configuration drag(induced drag) reduce optimization was carried out to validate the code and a superior one was found.
