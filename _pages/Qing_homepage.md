Biography
======
I am a second year postgraduate student in school of aeronautics at Northwestern Polytechnical University, major in flight vehible design advised by Prof.Yu Hu.  
Being a lab member of which [made the first successful flight of double ducted fan in China](http://www.miit.gov.cn/n1146290/n1146402/n1146445/c5637908/content.html). My research primarily involve aerodynamic optimization algorithms and its applications. I'm working with ducted fan projectes and trying to find out the design strategies from a surrogate based optimization approach. I also have some experience in design and optimization of fixed wing aircrafts.    
I will apply for PhD for fall semester of 2019 and I am interested in optimization algorithms and design & optimization related programs.  My information is attached in the [CV page](https://tsingqaq.github.io/cv/). And some projects I've participated are also provided [here](https://tsingqaq.github.io/projects/). If you're interested for more details, donâ€™t hesitate to contact me.
