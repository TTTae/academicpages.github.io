Enrich Sequence to Sequence Video to Text Captioning with Action Recognition
===
Vision and Language, Sep 2020 - Dec 2020
* Proposed a novel model, S2VTACT,  to capture action features from video skeleton graphs with spatial-temporal GCN 
* Utilized a stack of 2 recurrent units(GRU) encoders and decoders to learn video captioning with injected action features
* Investigated video captioning and applications of natural language processing (NLP)
